# Portland-Trimet-Live-Map-SERVER

**THIS REPO IS NOT USED. SEE THE SERVER AND CLIENT [HERE](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Portland-Trimet-Live-Map)**

Decided to package the server and client together. Made more sense as I don't have any plans to build other front-end interfaces to interact with the server currently. I'm leaving this repo up for now in case I do decide to build a new front-end in the future and package the server on its own...
